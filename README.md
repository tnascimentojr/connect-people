Connect People Application:
  - A social network exclusively focused in organizing events with your network. When you add friends you get access to their created events and they get access to yours.
  - Developed for a 24h hackathon as the last project of a 14 weeks programming bootcamp.
  - Disclaimer: the application will be further developed.

  - RestAPI done in Java using Spring MVC.
  - Frontend consists in Javascript and HTML.


(Sugestion) To run the app on your machine:
  - If you have tomcat, insert the command "mvn tomcat7:deploy" in the terminal in the project's directory.
  - Regarding the Frontend, we suggest creating a webserver from the "views" directory.
